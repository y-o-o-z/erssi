/*
 keyring.json on disk - the file and layout of rpe2e.pl 0.2.2:

   { "identity": { "pk", "sk", "fp", "created_at" },
     "peers": { <fp hex>: { "pk", "last_handle", "last_nick", "first_seen",
                            "last_seen", "status" } },
     "outgoing": { <ctx>: { "sk", "created_at", "pending_rotation" } },
     "incoming": { "<handle>|<ctx>": { "fp", "sk", "status", "created_at" } },
     "channels": { <ctx>: { "enabled", "mode" } },
     "pending": { "<ctx>|<handle>": { "eph_sk", "handle", "channel", "created_at" } },
     "autotrust": [ { "scope", "handle_pattern", "created_at" } ],
     "outgoing_recipients": { "<ctx>|<handle>": { "channel", "handle",
                                                  "fingerprint", "first_sent_at" } },
     "pending_inbound": { "<handle>|<ctx>": { ... the KEYREQ ... } },
     "pending_trust_change": [ { "handle", "channel", "change", ... } ] }

 Keys are base64; <ctx> is a channel name or "@ident@host" for a query.

 The same safety as rpe2e.pl: a file that exists but cannot be read is
 never replaced (the outbound gate refuses to send instead); a file that
 is not JSON is moved aside to keyring.json.corrupt-<time>; a write goes to
 a new 0600 file (O_EXCL), is fsync'ed and renamed over, then the
 directory is fsync'ed. Unlike rpe2e.pl, a keyring moved aside is not
 replaced by an empty one: while keyring.json is missing and a
 keyring.json.corrupt-* exists, the state is LOST (nothing is saved, the
 gate refuses) until e2e_keyring_start_fresh (/e2e reset).

 Members of this client only, kept by rpe2e.pl as unknown members:
     "accepted": { "<handle>|<ctx>": { "fp", "accepted_at", "by" } },
     "seen_rekeys": { "<fp>|<ctx>": { <REKEY nonce b64>: <seen at> } }
